    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // With arrays you have to make sure that if you refernce an
    // exisiting array, you have to remebeer that it is a shllow copy.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // Some ways to copy teams are:
    const players2 = players.slice();
    const players3 = [...players];
    const players4 = [].concat( players );
    const players5 = Array.from( players );

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = Object.assign( {}, person, { number: 99 } );
    const person3 = JSON.parse( JSON.stringify( person2 ) );

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
